# Smart-Restaurant

#### OOAD project.

This project will help improve the customer-restaurant interaction.
Smart Restaurant System will allow a restaurant to easily manage an online menu which customers can browse and place order with minimum human interaction.

System will take orders directly from customers at the table, and at the end of the interaction it will provide smart payment options. Also, the customers can now order their food from the safety and comfort of their home and can choose to pick it up or get it delivered. 

With continuous feedback from customers, restaurant owner/manager will get various reports like: revenue generated, items sold, most sought after item. This will help them understand their sales and also help in reducing food wastage as they will prepare their food judiciously. Customer data can also be used to further improve user experience. They can also update the menu items so that advantages of dynamic menu can be utilised.

The delivery person can update an order to be “Delivered” after getting otp from the customer.

The chef can update the order status with just one click and it will be visible to customer in real time.
