# Smart-Restaurant
OOAD project
This project will help improve the customer-restaurant interaction.
System will take orders directly from customers at the table, and at the end of the interaction it will provide smart payment options.
With continuous feedback from customers, restaurant owner/manager will get various reports like: revenue generated, items sold, most sought after item. This will help them understand their sales and also help in reducing food wastage as they will prepare their food judiciously.
Customer data can also be used to further improve user experience.
