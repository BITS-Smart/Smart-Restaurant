# Smart Restaurant
In current formal dining environments, some form of physical static menu is utilised to convey the available food and beverage choices to customers. Said menus are generally paper based and hence impose restrictions on the textual real estate available and the ability a restaurateur has to update them. Also with the ongoing situation of COVID, such paper based menus act as a hindrance in providing a contactless dining experience. 
Three related concepts are encompassed by the general scope of the Smart Restaurant. The first pertains to the replacement of paper-based menus using an electronic format, the second relates to a complementary electronic strategy for the front of house handling of a customer’s order and the third surrounds the process of transferring said electronic orders to the kitchen for preparation. It should be noted that the suggested strategy incorporates the use of various hardware components.***Can these be in client requirements***

## Benefits
Greater flexibility in menus, an increase in restaurant productivity and capacity for extensive business auditing are the primary benefits associated with the Smart Restaurant. Menu updates can be rolled out at any time with no extra labour from printing and distributing new menus, allowing for more dynamic pricing and content changes. With the underlying software system taking responsibility for a customer’s order throughout its lifecycle, not only is accuracy ensured, but all actions are logged in a database for analysis and accountability of staff. This allows the company to audit and account staff, materials and restaurant efficiency, as well as to review exceptional circumstances for future handling.***Similarly can these be client req***

**(The below para is most probably in D requirements)**
The UI must adopt a fluent grid concept to layout contents on different screen resolutions. In fact, this project favours this approach because it requires smaller overheads to maintain separate sites and possible to achieve maximum reusability.
It  scales  down  or  hides  certain  UI  contents  to improve  presentation  on mobile browsers.

Business  process  may  not  too  be  the  focus  of  this  report,  but  possible improvement and automation should be considered as system requirements.
